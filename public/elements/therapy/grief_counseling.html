                </h1>
    <p>Grief is the emotional response to any type of loss. Perhaps of a loved one due to death or divorce, but also the loss of a job, a pet, financial stability, or safety after trauma. Feelings of grief can be &nbsp;overwhelming, and it can be hard to know how to manage and overcome these emotions. It is important to have patience with yourself and others during this process as it is a healthy part of healing. If you are having trouble coping on your own, or know of someone who could use extra support, a therapist can assist.<br></p>
<p>There is no orderly process of passing through stages of anger, denial and acceptance. Everyone experiences loss differently based on their personality, culture, and beliefs, among many other factors. </p>
<p><b>Common symptoms of grief include: </b></p>
<ul><li>Shock and disbelief: feeling numb about the event, having trouble believing it happened, denying it, or expecting to suddenly see the person you lost.</li><li>Sadness: crying, or having feelings of emptiness, despair, yearning, or loneliness.</li><li>Guilt: regret over things unsaid or undone, feeling responsible for the death or the event, or shame from feeling relieved by a person’s passing. </li><li>Anger: blaming someone for injustice.</li><li>Fear: feelings of anxiety, helplessness, and insecurity, or having panic attacks.</li><li>Physical symptoms: fatigue, nausea, weight loss or gain, aches and pains, and insomnia.</li></ul>
<p><b>Coping with Grief and Loss</b></p>
<p>An important part of healing is knowing that you are not alone. Seek support from your friends, family, or faith, or join a bereavement support group. Sharing your loss can make the grieving process easier. Remember to take care of yourself; to eat, sleep, and exercise even when you’re too stressed or fatigued to do so. A healthy alternative is to seek the help of a professional therapist. A therapist can help you work through your intense emotions in a safe environment. </p>
