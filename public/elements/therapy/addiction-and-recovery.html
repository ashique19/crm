                Addiction And Recovery

<p>An addiction is a chronic disorder in which an individual is blinded by a substance, or engages in an activity, that gives them an immense amount of pleasure but has become detrimental to their everyday life. Compulsive behaviors and addictions can temporarily provide confidence, control, validation or other emotions lacking in one’s life, but the behavior may not stop until the root of the problem is addressed.<br></p>

<p><b><strong>Common addictions include but are not limited to:</strong></b></p>
<ul><li>Drug or alcohol abuse</li><li>Gambling</li><li>Internet</li><li>Shopping</li><li>Food</li></ul>

<p>People who have developed an addiction may be unaware that it is out of control, which is why counseling is an essential part of working through and managing this condition. An addiction of any sort can be exhausting and one should never go through the recovery process alone.</p>

During these sessions, patients analyze the reasons behind their addiction(s), what triggers are and what helped them control impulses in the past. Patients also learn coping skills so they can manage the compulsions without relapsing.</span></p>
