                    Grief and Loss
                </h1>    <p>Throughout the course of our years, we all experience a loss at some point in our lives. In fact, statistics show that 1 in 5 children will experience the death of someone close to them before 18 years of age. Feelings of grief and loss are not always associated with death, however, but commonly surface after a loss of some kind – whether it is the loss of a loved one, a severed relationship, a pregnancy, a pet, or a job.<br></p>
<p>When a person loses something or someone valuable to them, feelings of grief can be overbearing. Grief can leave a person feeling sad, hopeless, isolated, irritable, and numb by affecting them mentally, emotionally, and physically. It’s important to understand that healing from grief is a process and everyone copes with this emotion differently.</p>
<p>Many people don’t know what to say or do when a person is grieving, but be sure to have patience with the individual (including yourself) throughout the entire process. </p>
<p><b>An alternative treatment method includes psychotherapy. Through psychotherapy, a patient may:</b></p>
<p>· &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improve coping skills</p>
<p>· &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce feelings of blame and guilt</p>
<p>· &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explore and process emotions</p>
<p>Consider seeking professional support if feelings of grief do not ease over time.</p>
