                Work and Career Issues
            </h1>
    <p>Most of us spend more time at work than at home, therefore the workplace should be an environment where we feel safe and comfortable. However, because work is where a bunch of different personalities, communication styles, and worldviews gather around, things donâ€™t always go smoothly. In fact, workplace bullying is on the rise and though statistics vary, some studies reveal that nearly half of all American workers have been affected by this problem, either as a target or as a witness to abusive behavior against a co-worker.<br></p>
<p>Examples of common workplace issues include: </p>
<ul><li>Poor job fit</li><li>Mental anguish</li><li>Sexual or verbal harassment</li><li>Discrimination</li><li>Low motivation and job dissatisfaction </li></ul>
<p><b>How a Therapist Can Help</b></p>
<p>Therapy for work and career issues can help a person develop a better understanding of their wants and needs as well as approach alternative ways to handle tension while on the clock. &nbsp;Therapy is a neutral setting where patients can discuss their fears, worries, or stressors, and regain control of their happiness. </p>
<p>Psychotherapy tends to work well when addressing workplace issues because talk therapy such as this can effectively treat depression and anxiety that can stem from these conflicts. A mental health professional can also teach coping skills that will help a person manage work-related stress. </p>
