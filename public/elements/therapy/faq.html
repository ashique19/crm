<h3><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">How can Therapy Help me?</span></strong><a name="therapyhelp" style="display: block;position: relative;top: -98px;visibility: hidden;"></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">A number of benefits are available from participating in therapy. Therapists can provide support, problem-solving skills, and enhanced coping strategies for issues such as depression, anxiety, relationship troubles, unresolved childhood issues, grief, stress management, body image issues and creative blocks. Many people also find that counselors can be a tremendous asset to managing personal growth, interpersonal relationships, family concerns, marriage issues, and the hassles of daily life. Therapists can provide a fresh perspective on a difficult problem or point you in the direction of a solution. The benefits you obtain from therapy depend on how well you use the process and put into practice what you learn. Some of the benefits available from therapy include:

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Everyone goes through challenging situations in life, and while you may have successfully navigated through other difficulties you've faced, there's nothing wrong with seeking out extra support when you need it. In fact, therapy is for people who have enough self-awareness to realize they need a helping hand, and that is something to be admired. You are taking responsibility by accepting where you're at in life and making a commitment to change the situation by seeking therapy. Therapy provides long-lasting benefits and support, giving you the tools you need to avoid triggers, re-direct damaging patterns, and overcome whatever challenges you face.</span>

<h3><span style="font-size: 16px;">Why do people go to therapy and how do I know if it is right for me?</span> <a name="whytherapy" style="display: block;position: relative;top: -98px;visibility: hidden;"></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">People have many different motivations for coming to psychotherapy.   Some may be going through a major life transition (unemployment, divorce, new job, etc.), or are not handling stressful circumstances well.  Some people need assistance managing a range of other issues such as low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, addictions, relationship problems, spiritual conflicts and creative blocks.  Therapy can help provide some much needed encouragement and help with skills to get them through these periods.  Others may be at a point where they are ready to learn more about themselves or want to be more effective with their goals in life.   In short, people seeking psychotherapy are ready to meet the challenges in their lives and ready to make changes in their lives.</span>

<h3><span style="font-size: 16px;">What is Therapy like?<a name="whatistherapy" style="display: block;position: relative;top: -98px;visibility: hidden;"></a></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Because each person has different issues and goals for therapy, therapy will be different depending on the individual.  In general, you can expect to discuss the current events happening in your life, your personal history relevant to your issue, and report progress (or any new insights gained) from the previous therapy session.  Depending on your specific needs, therapy can be short-term, for a specific issue, or longer-term, to deal with more difficult patterns or your desire for more personal development.  Either way, it is most common to schedule regular sessions with your therapist (usually weekly).

</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">It is important to understand that you will get more results from therapy if you actively participate in the process.  The ultimate purpose of therapy is to help you bring what you learn in session back into your life.  Therefore, beyond the work you do in therapy sessions, your therapist may suggest some things you can do outside of therapy to support your process - such as reading a pertinent book, journaling on specific topics, noting particular behaviors or taking action on your goals. People seeking psychotherapy are ready to make positive changes in their lives, are open to new perspectives and take responsibility for their lives.</span>

<h3><span style="font-size: 16px;">What about medication vs. psychotherapy? <a name="medvspsy" style="display: block;position: relative;top: -98px;visibility: hidden;"></a><br></span>
</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">It is well established that the long-term solution to mental and emotional problems and the pain they cause cannot be solved solely by medication. Instead of just treating the symptom, therapy addresses the cause of our distress and the behavior patterns that curb our progress. You can best achieve sustainable growth and a greater sense of well-being with an integrative approach to wellness.  Working with your medical doctor you can determine what's best for you, and in some cases a combination of medication and therapy is the right course of action.</span>

<h3><span style="font-size: 16px;">Do you take insurance, and how does that work? <a name="insurance" style="display: block;position: relative;top: -98px;visibility: hidden;"></a><br></span>
</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To determine if you have mental health coverage through your insurance carrier, the first thing you should do is call them.  Check your coverage carefully and make sure you understand their answers.  Some helpful questions you can ask them:
	</span>
	</span>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 16px;">What are my mental health benefits?</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 16px;">What is the coverage amount per therapy session?</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 16px;">How many therapy sessions does my plan cover?</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 16px;">How much does my insurance pay for an out-of-network provider?</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Is approval required from my primary care physician? </span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Confidentiality is one of the most important components between a client and psychotherapist. Successful therapy requires a high degree of trust with highly sensitive subject matter that is usually not discussed anywhere but the therapist's office.   Every therapist should provide a written copy of their confidential disclosure agreement, and you can expect that what you discuss in session will not be shared with anyone.  This is called “Informed Consent”.  Sometimes, however, you may want your therapist to share information or give an update to someone on your healthcare team (your Physician, Naturopath, Attorney), but by law your therapist cannot release this information without obtaining your written permission.
	</span>
	</span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, state law and professional ethics require therapists to maintain confidentiality except for the following situations:
	</span>
	</span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">* Suspected past or present abuse or neglect of children, adults, and elders to the authorities, including Child Protection and law enforcement, based on information provided by the client or collateral sources.
	</span>
	</span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 16px;">* If the therapist has reason to suspect the client is seriously in danger of harming him/herself or has threated to harm another person.</span>
